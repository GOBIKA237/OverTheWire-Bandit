Level Goal 
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.
The important thing in over the wire is to notice the commands you need to solve this level
In here it is given as ssh

ssh 
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol for secure remote login and command execution
ssh username@hostname: to log in to the remote server 

So the command needed is :
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

it might ask password which is nothing but bandit0. 

In this level the password is given but in preceding levels you might need to complete a task or view inside a file content mostly
to get the password for usernames bandit1,bandit2,bandit3,etc....

It should appear like this below:
